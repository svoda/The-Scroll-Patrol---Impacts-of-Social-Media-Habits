### Social Media Addiction Analysis and Intervention
This project leverages Big Data mining techniques to analyze social media addiction patterns and propose data-driven interventions. Using a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and clustering techniques, we identify key factors contributing to addiction and classify users based on their risk levels.     
The project includes:    
- Clustering techniques such as PCA, Agglomerative Clustering, and LSH for behavior grouping.       
- Predictive modeling with Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest to quantify addiction predictors.     
- Classification using Random Forest and Naive Bayes for user categorization.    
- Recommendation system to propose alternatives to addictive patterns.    
- Graph Network Analysis with PageRank to identify influential users.    
The goal is to provide actionable insights to help mitigate social media addiction, enhance mental health, and improve productivity.
